# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Working on this project was challenging but also very helpful
- Learning how to solve problems on my own by searching through the lessons and referring to lesson tasks was useful
- Parts of the project that I struggled with was positioning elements and using animations
- By working through this project I gained a better understanding of BEM as well as how to use the transition property
- One way to improve the project would be to add more animations and forms to the project, as those are two very complex tasks I spent a lot of time trying to learn and implement
